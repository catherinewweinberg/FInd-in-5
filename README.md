## **The Problem**
Analysis paralysis (choice paralysis) is the psychological phenomenon when overanalyzing and overthinking causes paralysis in decision-making.
Netflix causes that problem when the user interface is cluttered with Netflix Originals, series and popular movies.
The levels of stress and anxiety that can come from the various options can change a movie night into one left on this carousel.

So what if that carousel only listed top movies from a genre that you're interested in? **Enter Find in 5**

## **Our Solution**
With our platform, we reduce the choices to whatever is available on Netflix.
Utilizing our database calls, we filter through the top searched movies for that decade and in return, recommend you movies that are available for your viewing pleasure.
